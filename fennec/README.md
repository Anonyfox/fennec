# fennec — the runtime

The HTTP server, middleware, isomorphic UI, and reactive data layer. One package, several libs; the
precise API lives inline in each module's `.mli`. `Fennec` (the `app` lib) is the facade you call.
(`fennec/hunt/` and `fennec/mongo/` alongside are the sibling `fennec-hunt` / `fennec-mongo` packages
— their own READMEs.)

## HTTP core — `fennec.core`

Request/response, `Http.meth`, MIME, HTTP-date, RFC semantics (ETag / Range / conditional), cookies,
multipart, and a WebSocket channel. RFC-correct, colocated unit tests.

## Paw — the middleware primitive — `fennec.paw`

A **paw** is `Conn.t -> Conn.t`: it *declines* (passes through) or *answers* (short-circuits the
rest). Routes, static serving, the websocket upgrade, and the SSR app are all paws. Compose with
`Paw.seq`; order is precedence. **The default is nothing** — add capability as needs grow:

| when you want… | paw |
|---|---|
| request logs · trace id · metrics | `Logger` · `Request_id` · `Metrics` |
| security headers · CORS · rate-limit | `Security_headers` · `Cors` · `Rate_limit` |
| sessions · CSRF · basic-auth | `Session` · `Csrf` · `Basic_auth` |
| HTTP→HTTPS behind a proxy | `Force_https` |

Write your own in a line: `let mine : Paw.t = fun c -> Conn.before_send c (…)`.

## Server — `fennec.server`

A compact Eio HTTP/1.1 + WebSocket server: static serving (strong ETag / 304 / Range / HEAD), gzip +
deflate, WebSocket permessage-deflate, multi-app routing by Host, graceful shutdown.
`Fennec.serve [endpoints]` is the single entry point.

## HTTPS — in-process, opt in incrementally

No nginx, no reverse proxy; pure-OCaml TLS (`tls` / `x509` / `mirage-crypto`), no Lwt.

| `Fennec.serve …` | you get |
|---|---|
| `[eps]` | plain HTTP — `:80` in prod; `$PORT` / `FENNEC_PORT` behind a proxy or PaaS |
| `~tls:(Tls.of_files ~cert ~key)` | your own certificate — `:443` + a `:80`→https redirect |
| `~acme:(Acme.auto ())` | automatic Let's Encrypt for every declared domain — renewed, zero-downtime hot-reload |
| `~acme:(Acme.auto ~dns_provider …)` | + **wildcard** certs via DNS-01 (`*.tenant.app`) |
| `~acme:(Acme.auto ~on_demand …)` | + per-customer domains issued **on first connect** |

Dev-safe (ACME no-ops in dev — never hits Let's Encrypt). Pluggable cert store: `file` (default) ·
`memory` · a custom value (k8s Secret / S3 / Redis), with a multi-instance lease. Self-contained
binaries link `libgmp` statically across the mac / linux (incl. musl) matrix.

## Fur — the isomorphic UI — `fennec.fur`

Components written in OCaml that server-render to HTML and hydrate in the browser, from one source.
Signals (`signal` / `get` / `set`), a vdom + reconciler, a typed file-tree router, a `<Head>` manager,
and data resources with fast-render seeds. No React / Melange / preact runtime — the client is a
js_of_ocaml bundle.

## Reactive data + realtime — `fennec.data` · `.ddp` · `.live` · `.realtime`

Meteor-style sync: DDP publications/subscriptions over WebSocket, a Mongo/minimongo query + observe
engine with change-stream-backed **live queries**, and **SSR-with-live-data** — the server renders
live data into the first paint, the browser hydrates it flicker-free, then the subscription streams
deltas. In-memory by default; an optional native Mongo driver (`fennec-mongo`) for production.
